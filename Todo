Find a way to get the index from the WorldList class to index the WorldList array
So that the replace letter method can be used to replace the letter in the word in order
to not only replace the first occurance of the letter but all of them withing the index range.

I think I can do this by using the index of the letter in the word to replace the letter in the word
with the letter in the wordlist array.

example : for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++){
    if(word.charAt(i) == letter){
        word.replace(word.charAt(i), letter);
    }
}
